[Create Account:](https://www.eosaccountservices.com/create-account.html)

Type the name you want, save your password, and you're ready to get on-chain. It can't get much simpler than that! The textbox will ensure your name is valid and available, while the checkout button won't let you proceed until you're certain your password is safely stored.

Accounts created on EAS get a free PowerUp, plus a bonus 680 bytes of RAM!

[Get RAM:](https://www.eosaccountservices.com/resources.html)

Instead of directly dealing in EOS with the automated market, which requires some know-how, EAS offers RAM in a few clicks. Never run into "insufficient RAM" errors again.

All RAM purchases come with a free PowerUp.

[Vanity Keys:](https://www.eosaccountservices.com/vanity-keys.html)

EAS is the only place to get an EOS Vanity Key. Choose whatever prefix you'd like, then click to generate. After the estimated waiting period, your EOS key pair will be found and displayed. A few more clicks and keyboard clacks and your key will become valid and ready to be used on-chain.

All vanity keys are generated in your browser and can be done so offline and in incognito mode. They are 100% random and 100% secure using EOSJS' key generation. Your private key never leaves your browser. EAS is open source, so you never need to wonder.

[Create NFTs:](https://www.eosaccountservices.com/create-nft.html)

Creating NFTs...heck, even understand NFTs, is a complicated business. EOS' dominate standard requires many steps to begin minting your first NFT. Even then, you might need additional know-how to mint certain NFTs.

EAS offers NFTs in an unbelievably simple way. Title, description, and upload media, that's it. EAS is the only way to create video, audio, image, and whatever-else NFTs on EOS without any technical knowledge.

[Create Custom Token:](https://www.eosaccountservices.com/create-token.html)

If you have a name and a maximum supply in mind, you're ready to go. EAS guides users through token creation in a hassle and tech free way. In one minute, users can deploy a token contract to their private account and start managing their token. Everything is handled behind the scenes and is delivered immediately.
